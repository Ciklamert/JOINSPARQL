# Implementation and comparison of join algorithms for SPARQL query processing

In this project, we implemented some of the most popular join algorithms: Sort-merge join and Hash join algorithms. We then propose an improved algorithm that has better performance than both algorithms. Finally, we benchmarked each algorithm in terms of their performance. These benchmarks include executing identical queries on the same dataset using each algorithm.

The algorithm descriptions and our findings are presented in "report.pdf"

This project was done for the Advanced Database and Information Systems course at the University of Freiburg.
